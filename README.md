# Design-of-robust-controller-for-vibration-control-of-vehicles
Vehicle vibration originates from road roughness. The main objective of the active vibration
control of vehicle suspension systems is to get security and comfort for the passengers by reducing
to zero the vertical acceleration of the body of the vehicle. An actuator incorporated
to the suspension system applies control forces to the vehicle body for reducing its vertical acceleration
in active or semiactive way. The topic of active vehicle suspension control system
is quite challenging. The aim of this project is to design a robust control scheme to control
vibration of vehicles suspension system.

## Problem statement:
> **Design a robust control System for Vibration Control of Vehicles**

The work is done in two phases (two semsters). 
### First phase: 
A robust strategy is studied for controlling the active suspension system using a quarter-car
model. A proportional-integral sliding mode control scheme (PISMC) is used for this purpose.
The performance of the controller is compared to the linear quadratic regulator(LQR) and with
the existing uncompensated system. A simulation study is performed to prove the effectiveness
and robustness of the control approach. Quadratic Performance Index (J) for different inputs
and different controlling techniques is also calculated.
### Second phase:
A robust strategy is studied for controlling the active suspension system using a Full 7-DOF
car model. The proposed control scheme uses a PID-SMC to generate the tracking signal for
four wheel subsystems of actuators for mitigating the road disturbances. The performance of
the controller is compared to the nominal open loop model uncompensated system. Along with
vertical disturbance, we also introduced the turning road disturbance in order to check the roll
angle.
